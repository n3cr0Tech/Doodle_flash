# Doodle_flash
Make doodles with this ActionScript based application.
I made this back in high school when flash animations/games were still popular.
It just opens up a blank white screen and allows you to draw with different colors (i.e., black, white, blue, green, red, and yellow).
It also has a "clear" button that will delete all your doodles.
